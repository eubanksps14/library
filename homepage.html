   			The Mountain Vista library is now 15 years old! It has
   			been here since the school’s opening in 2001. It’s main
   			reason is to checkout/in books, but recently our library has
   			gone somewhat online! It has always been a place for people
   			to work on homework or projects. Also, people can just hangout
   			in the library on the couches with their friends. The MVHS
 			library is the most social and well utilized part of the school.
  			Along with just being a place to hangout and read, the library
   			offers clubs if you are really into reading.
	 		It is referred to as the MVHS Book Club. The MVHS Book
	 		Club provides students with the opportunity to meet on a
	 		regular basis to discuss books they have read. They meet the 
	 		second Thursday of every month during SOAR at 8:15 a.m. in 
	 		the library conference room. The teacher sponsors of this 
			club are Kim Cox and Julie Jacobs. Julie Jacobs is one of 
	 		Mountain Vista’s media specialists. She is in the library 
	 		everyday from 7:15 a.m. to 3 p.m. everyday. Along with being 
	 		a co-sponsor for the book club Kim Cox teaches many design 
	 		classes. She teaches Interior Design courses I and II. When 
	 		she is not teaching design classes she is helping with child 
	 		development and professional internship. Overall the Mountain 
	 		Vista Library is a very innovative place where there is 
	 		opportunities to be involved with things such as our book club, 
	 		but it is also a place to collaborate and be social with your peers.
